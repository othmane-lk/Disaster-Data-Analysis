# Disaster-Data-Analysis
Analyzing a dataset spanning global disasters from 1900 to 2021 involves collecting and cleaning data to include variables like disaster type, location, date, and death toll. Through exploratory data analysis, trends in disaster frequency, types, and geographic distribution can be identified, highlighting regions with higher risk. By analyzing the frequency and severity of disasters by type and location, high-risk areas for humanity can be pinpointed, considering factors like population density and infrastructure vulnerability. The analysis culminates in recommendations for policymakers and community leaders to enhance disaster preparedness, response, and mitigation efforts, while ensuring ethical considerations regarding human loss and vulnerability are addressed.
